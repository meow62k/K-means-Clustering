K-means-Clustering

Assignment:
1. Apply K-Means clustering with K=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 for all 56 datasets and find the optimal value of clusters using Silhouette Coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index.
2. Store your results with single excel file with multiple rows i.e., one row for each project and Column used to represent Silhouette Coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index.

For Each Data-set: Column 1 to column 20 containing features and last column contain class information.

Code:
Main.ipynb contains the main code for finding the Silhouette Coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index for the given dataset.
boxplot.ipynb contains the code for plotting the boxplot and calculating its descriptive statistics. 

In Data:
The 56 datasets provived. 

In Outputs:
1. Main output file contains the raw output data. 
2. db.csv file contains the Davies-Bouldin Index.
3. si.csv file contains the Silhouette Coefficient.
4. Selecting the optimal number of clusters for KMeans clustering.xlsx file contains the Boxplots and the descriptive statistics of the Boxplot. 

Solution: 2 is the most optimal value of clusters using Silhouette Coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index for the given data.
